# ReadMe for Comp20 Assignment 4
### Security Review of MapChat

### Notes:
###### What was done:
Well there was a slight hiccup getting started (as there was no code to start with), so in a better-late-than-never fashion, the whole document has been written. It has all five sections as well as many screenshots and descripts, as well as mild formatting. What was not done was move things like <strong></strong> into a CSS file for good coding practice. Doing this wouldn't make a huge different to how the code actually looks its just sort of ugly and unhappy to have the style elements inside the html. No matter though cause it works.

###### Collaboration
Just me (as most everybody else had finished before I started so that was fun)

###### Time Commitment
Took a few hours to be honest. The third flaw (access other people's data) took about an hour just to find, but after that the writing was pretty straightfoward and not too long. All in all I'd say three hours were spent working on Assignment 4.
