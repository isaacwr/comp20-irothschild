### Captain's Log

#### What works
On page load: Displays all previously stored messages with the most recent at the top.
On enter key pressed: Gives any non-empty message typed into the input box a timestamp, prints to top of screen, and stores in localstorage.

#### Collaborators
Just me this time.

#### Time commitment
This took a little less than 2 hours.
Would have been less if I'd read jQuery documentation before writing, so that's a good lesson.
