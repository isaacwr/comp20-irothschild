# Map Chat

### What works
Current location is found using JavaScript navigator.geolocation and is pushed onto a Google basemap with a special icon (me.png).
All student data is gathered using an XMLHttpRequest and parsed to add regular markers for each other student with their login, message, and the distance in miles from my pin using the Haversine distance formula.

### Collaboration
Just me this time

### Time commitment
Probably five-ish hours but they were pretty fun and we had forever to do the assignment so it was no pressure.
