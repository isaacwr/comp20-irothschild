### Private Repo for Comp20 Assignments and Labs

###### Purpose
The purpose of this repo is (a) to practice using Git, and (b) to provide a place for testing and verifying and 'turning in' assignments.

###### Favorite Assignment
Without a doubt the Semester Group Project was my favorite. For so many reasons. Not only was it a group project (which is great because the other students at Tufts are great), it was a completely open ended project that left all of the creativity to us. We were able to come with an idea and had to execute on it *however we saw fit*, and not just follow a checkist of functions or functionality to write in some sort of static process. I think the process from start to finish was also rewarding because at the end we all had to present our projects and we knew that everybody started with the same instructions and then wrote their first code and built and refined the app until it was presentable and something that we could be proud of.

###### How much do you think you have grown
A lot. The only web programming I had done before was to build a web app over summer, and I had zero education about what to do coming in, and zero direction in building it, and so I build (in retrospect) a very strange app that handled things in awkward ways, and now that I've been exposed to a more formal education I feel like I understand how the web works in a more substantial way. There is obviously so much I don't know, but it takes away from the 'magic' of how things happen and I can now confidently answer the question 'What happens when you enter an address in a browser', and 'What is a cookie'.

###### What do you want to dive deeper into?
Databases. I wasn't wowed by writing in Javascript and a lot of of the error handling felt very vague. (For instance all the 503's that I never figured out :( ) But storing data and using Ajax to get data was super fun and I want to learn more about SQL and how real data is stored in the real world.
